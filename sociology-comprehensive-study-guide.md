## 1. FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIOLOGY

### Definition and Scope
- **Sociology**: The scientific study of human societies, interactions among individuals and groups, and processes that preserve and transform social structures
- **Focus Areas**: Social institutions (family, education, religion), stratification systems (class, race, gender), social movements, and social change
- **Sociological Perspective**: Understanding human behavior as shaped by social forces rather than purely individual choices

### Historical Origins
Emerged in early 19th century during three major historical developments:
- **Enlightenment**: Application of scientific rationality to human affairs
  - Shift from theological to scientific understanding of society
- **French Revolution**: Raised questions about social order and change
  - Demonstrated how radical social change was possible
- **Industrial Revolution**: Created unprecedented social transformations
  - Urbanization, capitalism, new labor problems requiring systematic study

### Founding Figures
- **Auguste Comte**: 
  - Coined "sociology" as "social physics"; advocated positivism
  - **Law of three stages**:
    - Theological stage: Supernatural explanations
    - Metaphysical stage: Abstract forces as explanations
    - Positive stage: Scientific observation and laws

- **Émile Durkheim**: 
  - Focused on social order, solidarity, and collective consciousness
  - Studied suicide to demonstrate social factors affecting individual behavior
  - Concepts: Anomie, mechanical vs. organic solidarity

- **Karl Marx**: 
  - Analyzed conflict, class struggle, and economic determinism
  - **Alienation under capitalism**:
    - Alienation from product: Workers don't own what they produce
    - Alienation from process: Work becomes mechanical and meaningless
    - Alienation from human essence: Creative potential unfulfilled
    - Alienation from fellow humans: Competition replaces cooperation
  - **Historical materialism**: Prediction of socialism replacing capitalism

- **Max Weber**: 
  - Emphasized interpretive understanding (verstehen) and meaning in social action
  - Three-dimensional theory of stratification: class, status, and power
  - Analysis of bureaucracy and rationalization

### Sociology vs. Common Sense
- **Scientific Approach**: Sociology is systematic, not based on common sense
  - Uses rigorous methods rather than assumptions
- **Example**: Media portrayal vs sociological study (e.g., cross-region marriages, child kidnapping)
  - Media sensationalizes vs sociology examines structural causes
- **Motives of sociology**: 
  - **Objectivity**: Removing personal bias
  - **Pattern finding**: Identifying recurring social trends
  - **Lived reality**: Understanding experiences of different groups
  - **No sensationalism**: Focus on social facts rather than exceptional cases
- **The "sociological imagination"** (Mills): Connecting personal troubles to public issues

## 3. RESEARCH METHODS

### Scientific Method in Sociology
- Hypothesis, observation, data collection, analysis
- Challenges of studying human subjects:
  - Hawthorne effect (subjects change behavior when observed)
  - Participant bias
  - Researcher bias

### Research Approaches
- **Positivism** (cause-effect focus): 
  - Discovering social laws through empirical observation
  - Quantitative measurement and statistical analysis
- **Phenomenology** (meanings): 
  - Understanding subjective human experiences
  - Focus on lived experiences and interpretations
- **Critical Approach** (structures of power): 
  - Examining how social structures perpetuate inequality
  - Often action-oriented toward social change

### Methodological Approaches
- **Quantitative Methods**:
  - **Surveys**: Collecting standardized data from large populations
  - **Statistics**: Analyzing numerical patterns and correlations
  - **Experiments**: Testing causal relationships under controlled conditions
  - Strengths: Generalizable, replicable, systematic

- **Qualitative Methods**:
  - **Ethnography**: Immersive study of cultures and communities
  - **Interviews**: In-depth conversations to understand subjective experiences
  - **Content analysis**: Examining texts, media, and cultural artifacts
  - **Focus groups**: Group discussions on specific topics
  - Strengths: Rich detail, contextual understanding, flexibility

### Objectivity and Ethics
- **Weber**: "Value-relevance" vs. "value-neutrality"
  - Topics value-laden, outcomes must be value-free
- **Triangulation**: Using multiple methods to verify findings
- **Research Ethics**:
  - Informed consent
  - Confidentiality/privacy
  - Avoiding harm to participants
