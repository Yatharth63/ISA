## 1. FOUNDATIONS OF SOCIOLOGY

### Definition and Scope
- **Sociology**: The scientific study of human societies, interactions among individuals and groups, and processes that preserve and transform social structures
- **Focus Areas**: Social institutions (family, education, religion), stratification systems (class, race, gender), social movements, and social change
- **Sociological Perspective**: Understanding human behavior as shaped by social forces rather than purely individual choices
  - **Example**: While psychology might explain unemployment as resulting from an individual's lack of motivation, sociology examines structural factors like economic recessions, automation, or discrimination in hiring practices

### Historical Origins
Emerged in early 19th century during three major historical developments:
- **Enlightenment**: Application of scientific rationality to human affairs
  - Shift from theological to scientific understanding of society
  - **Example**: Moving from explaining poverty as "God's will" to examining economic structures and social policies
- **French Revolution**: Raised questions about social order and change
  - Demonstrated how radical social change was possible
  - **Example**: Overthrow of monarchy showed that traditional social hierarchies could be challenged and replaced
- **Industrial Revolution**: Created unprecedented social transformations
  - Urbanization, capitalism, new labor problems requiring systematic study
  - **Example**: Mass migration from rural to urban areas created new social problems like overcrowding, pollution, and labor exploitation

### Founding Figures
- **Auguste Comte**: 
  - Coined "sociology" as "social physics"; advocated positivism
  - **Law of three stages**:
    - Theological stage: Supernatural explanations (e.g., "The plague is divine punishment")
    - Metaphysical stage: Abstract forces as explanations (e.g., "Natural forces cause social harmony")
    - Positive stage: Scientific observation and laws (e.g., "Statistical analysis shows correlation between education and income")

- **Ã‰mile Durkheim**: 
  - Focused on social order, solidarity, and collective consciousness
  - Studied suicide to demonstrate social factors affecting individual behavior
  - **Example**: Found that Protestant communities had higher suicide rates than Catholic ones, demonstrating that even seemingly individual acts are influenced by social factors

- **Karl Marx**: 
  - Analyzed conflict, class struggle, and economic determinism
  - **Alienation under capitalism**:
    - Alienation from product: Workers don't own what they produce (e.g., factory workers producing smartphones they can't afford)
    - Alienation from process: Work becomes mechanical and meaningless (e.g., assembly line work with repetitive tasks)
    - Alienation from human essence: Creative potential unfulfilled (e.g., artist working in advertising to pay bills rather than creating meaningful art)
    - Alienation from fellow humans: Competition replaces cooperation (e.g., colleagues competing for limited promotions)

- **Max Weber**: 
  - Emphasized interpretive understanding (verstehen) and meaning in social action
  - **Example**: To understand religious behavior, we must grasp what religion means to believers, not just observe external rituals
  - Analyzed how Protestant work ethic contributed to the rise of capitalism in Western Europe

### Sociology vs. Common Sense
- **Scientific Approach**: Sociology is systematic, not based on common sense
  - **Example**: Common sense might suggest that poverty results from laziness, but sociological research reveals structural factors like unequal access to education and employment opportunities
- **Media portrayal vs sociological study**:
  - **Example**: Media may sensationalize rare child kidnappings by strangers, while sociology shows most child abductions are by family members
  - **Example**: News reports might focus on individual "success stories" of immigrants, while sociology examines patterns of structural barriers facing immigrant communities
- **The "sociological imagination"** (Mills): Connecting personal troubles to public issues
  - **Example**: Viewing unemployment not just as a personal failure but as connected to economic downturns, outsourcing, and automation

## 2. THEORETICAL PERSPECTIVES

### Functionalist Perspective
- Society as an integrated system of parts working together
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Social functions**: Contributions to society's stability
  - **Manifest functions**: Intended consequences (e.g., education's manifest function is to transmit knowledge)
  - **Latent functions**: Unintended consequences (e.g., schools also function as childcare, allowing parents to work)
  - **Social dysfunction**: Elements that disrupt stability (e.g., crime undermines social order)
- **Example**: The family functions to socialize children, provide emotional support, and regulate sexual behavior
- **Example**: Religion functions to provide meaning, social cohesion, and moral guidance

### Conflict Perspective
- Society as a site of inequality and competition for resources
- **Key Concepts**:
  - **Class conflict**: Struggle between social classes
  - **Power relations**: Domination and subordination
  - **False consciousness**: Internalization of dominant ideology

- **Example**: Corporate media ownership influences which news stories receive coverage, typically favoring business interests

### Symbolic Interactionist Perspective
- Society as constructed through meaningful interactions and interpretations
- **Key Concepts**:

  - **Negotiated order**: Social patterns created through interaction
- **Example**: A wedding ring symbolizes marriage commitment across many cultures
- **Example**: Classroom interactions between teachers and students create expectations about appropriate behavior
- **Example**: How people interpret a smile (friendly, sarcastic, nervous) affects their response to it

## 3. RESEARCH METHODS

### Scientific Method in Sociology
- Hypothesis, observation, data collection, analysis
- **Example**: Testing hypothesis that religious service attendance correlates with political conservatism by surveying participants about their religious practices and political views
- Challenges of studying human subjects:
  - Hawthorne effect: Workers increased productivity when being studied regardless of experimental conditions
  - Participant bias: Survey respondents giving socially desirable answers rather than honest ones
  - Researcher bias: Unconsciously interpreting data to confirm pre-existing beliefs

### Research Approaches
- **Positivism** (cause-effect focus):

  - **Example**: Statistical analysis showing correlation between parental income and children's educational achievement
- **Phenomenology** (meanings): 
  - Understanding subjective human experiences
  - **Example**: In-depth interviews with homeless individuals about how they experience and make sense of their situation

  - Examining how social structures perpetuate inequality
  - **Example**: Analyzing how textbooks represent different racial groups to uncover hidden biases

### Methodological Approaches
- **Quantitative Methods**:
  - **Surveys**: 
    - **Example**: National opinion polls measuring attitudes toward climate change across different demographic groups
  - **Statistics**: 
    - **Example**: Regression analysis showing relationship between unemployment rates and crime
  - **Experiments**:

    - **Example**: Examining gender representation in popular television shows
  - **Focus groups**: 
    - **Example**: Group discussions with teenagers about social media use and mental health

### Objectivity and Ethics
- **Weber**: "Value-relevance" vs. "value-neutrality"
  - Topics value-laden, outcomes must be value-free
  - **Example**: A researcher may choose to study racial discrimination (value-relevant topic) but must analyze data objectively without predetermined conclusions
- **Triangulation**: Using multiple methods to verify findings
  - **Example**: Combining surveys, interviews, and observation to study workplace satisfaction
- **Research Ethics**:
  - **Example**: Ensuring participants in a study on sexual harassment are not retraumatized during interviews
  - **Example**: Protecting anonymity of whistleblowers in organizational research
